[WARNING]: Found both group and host with same name: dbsrv1
ERROR! conflicting action statements: template, backup

The error appears to be in '/home/max/my-ansible/prometheus/add_node_exporter_metrics.yaml': line 6, column 7, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

  tasks:
    - name: Создать шаблон конфигурации Prometheus
      ^ here
